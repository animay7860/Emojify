# Emojify
## A Deep Learning Model that creates an Avatar/Cartoon of your Real-time facial Emotion.
My Software when run, is capable of detecting 7 of the many human emotions which are visible on their faces. 
The output of our software will include two types of data as an output:-
1.	Name of the emotion detected.
2.	Respective Cartoon of the emotion detected.

Avataar/Cartoon are basically graphical representation of emotion. my software will be using these in order to make the working more interactive and fun.
## Motivation
Facial expression recognition plays a crucial role in the area of human-machine interaction. Automatic facial expression recognition system has many applications in various streams including medicine, E-Learning, monitoring, entertainment, law and marketing.
## Tech Stack Used
●	CNN: A Deep learning model to Recognize Facial Emotion.

●	OpenCV: To recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements etc.

●	Tensorflow 2:0: This is the latest version of the deep learning framework developed and maintained by Google and used for emotion classification.

●	Haar Cascade: haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml  is used for face detection.

●	Dataset: fer2013 dataset available from Kaggle is used for training the model to detect emotions.
